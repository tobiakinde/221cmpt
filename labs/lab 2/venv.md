## Lab #2 - Pip & Virtual Environments
**PIP**: Pip is installed with Python and enables us to install packages in our programs that aren't already included with Python by default. When you install packages with Pip, they're installed _globally_, which means they are available for all the projects you create _on your computer_.

**Note**: To complete this lab, Windows users will need to install Python if it is not already installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Note**: If you are a Windows user and run into issues with the commands provided in this lab, please try using bash/git bash instead of powershell.

First things first, let's prove you have pip installed by listing all the packages you have installed on your computer.

```bash
# list pip packages
python3 -m pip list
# or
pip list
```

This command outputs a list of all packages installed on your computer by pip and which version each package is.

Cool. But you may be thinking: what happens when different projects need the same package with different versions?

A **Virtual Environment** is an isolated workspace that allows us to keep dependenceies required by different projects separate. _What?_

It's not uncommon for you to have multiple Python projects on your computer, and sometimes those projects have different requirements. 

When you did a `pip list`, you saw versions next to each package. Different projects might require different versions of the same package. This is where virtual environments come in. When you create a virtual environment, you can install the version of a package you need for one project, and _your other projects won't be affected_. This is because your _scope_ has changed. You are now only installing packages _local_ to your virtual environment. Any projects inside the virtual environment will be affected, while those outside the virtual environment will not be affected. 

You run virtual environments locally (on your own computer), and you don't push them to github or include them in your final deliverable.

So, let's create one.

First, install `virtualenv` using pip:

```bash
# install virtualenv
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
# if you have issues with the above command, 
# install virtualenv as sudo, to avoid $PATH issues
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

`cd` to your `labs/lab\ 2/ directory` if you haven't already. For me, that looks like `/Users/calistaphippen/Github/cmpt221/cmpt221/labs/lab 2`. You can issue the `pwd` command to verify you're in the right directory.

**Note**: the backslash after 'lab' (lab\\ ) escapes the space

Create a virtual environment named .venv. This command creates a directory named `.venv` which is your virtual environment. Note that you can technically name your virtual environment
whatever you want, just make sure to add it to your gitignore file.
```bash
# create venv
virtualenv .venv
# or use this command if you get a command not found error
python3 -m virtualenv .venv
```
Notice the period before the word `venv`? This means the directory is hidden. You can view it with the `ls -a` command. If you click the drop down arrow next to the `.venv` directory icon in your side bar, and then click `bin` (or `Scripts` if you are on windows), you will see an `activate` script. We will call this script to activate our virtual environment.
```bash
# activate venv
# mac or bash
. .venv/bin/activate
# windows (cmd)
.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
# windows (powershell)
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
Once you have activated your virtual environment, install the following packages using pip:

```bash
# flask package
python3 -m pip install flask
# or
pip install flask
 
# sqlalchemy package (sql wrapper)
python3 -m pip install flask-sqlalchemy
# or
pip install flask-sqlalchemy

# click package
python3 -m pip install click
# or
pip install click
```

Then issue a `pip list` and make sure you see your newly installed packages in the list. 

To share your virtual environment (and submit this lab for a grade), make sure you are still in the `/labs/lab 2` directory and issue a `pip freeze`. If you are not in the right directory, you will export all of your installed packages, not just the ones in your virtual environment.
```bash
# store venv configurations
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

A `requirements.txt` file is simply a list of the modules and packages that your project needs to run. when you recieve a requirements.txt from others (this will be important as you will be working in groups) you can add those requirements to your virtual environment with a `pip install`

**Note**: You do not need to run this command for this lab.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deactivate the virtual environment using the `deactivate` command, then issue another `pip list`. What do you notice?
```bash
# deactivate venv
deactivate
```
If all has gone well, you should notice that upon deactivating your virtual environment, you no longer see the packages you just installed.

Once you have completed this lab, push your work to Github, open a pull request, assign me as a reviewer, and copy/paste the link to the pull request in Brightspace. Note: your `.venv` directory will not be pushed to git because of our `.gitignore`, but your `requirements.txt` file will be.

I will leave comments on your lab in the PR and your lab grade will be available in brightspace.
